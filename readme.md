A very engaging and immersive experience in which i learned the fundamentals of the cloud and infrastructure for 6 months

In this repo i wrote scripts via goodgle's SDK for python to perfrom basic and advanced tasks including creating and uploading file to google cloud storage, 
creating a VPC, and creating a private NAT gateway.
