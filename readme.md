# Scripts Used in the Google Africa Developer Scholarship 2020

A very engaging and immersive experience in which i learned the fundamentals of the cloud and infrastructure for 6 months
I got to the penultimate stage where i was among 10,000 selected worldwide

In this repo i wrote Shell scripts that used goodgle cloud SDK CLI to perfrom basic and advanced tasks including creating and uploading file to google cloud storage, creating a compute instance in a custom VPC and testing its reachability, as well as creating an private instance in custom VPC and enabling internet connectivity using a Cloud NAT gateway. 

Also wrote Shell and jinja2 scripts to deploy infrastructure using Google's Deployment Manager
